# Spec Initialization

## Feature Description

**From Roadmap Milestone #6:**
Connect mood selection → agent processing → Ollama generation → display pipeline, implement loading indicators, and optimize for <2s response time

## Raw User Input

> End-to-End Flow — Connect mood selection → agent processing → Ollama generation → display pipeline, implement loading indicators, and optimize for <2s response time `M`

## Initial Context

This is milestone #6 in the product roadmap. Previous milestones (1-5) have already been completed:
- ✅ Project initialization 
- ✅ Ollama integration setup
- ✅ Mood selection UI
- ✅ Agent architecture foundation
- ✅ Inspiration display card

The user reported an issue where selecting a mood card displays too much text instead of a single insightful message. This suggests the end-to-end flow needs refinement.

## Next Steps

Proceed to requirements gathering phase to understand:
1. What is currently working vs. not working in the flow
2. What constitutes "too much text" vs. desired output
3. Performance requirements and optimization needs
4. Loading indicator expectations
5. Error handling gaps in the flow
